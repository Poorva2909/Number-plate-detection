# Number-plate-detection

VEHICLE NUMBER PLATE DETECTION

 
OVERVIEW:
To reduce the problem of traffic congestion and human intervention we have come up with a solution of identifying the number plates of vehicles using ANPR.
The Vehicle Number Plate Detection is a system which is developed for recognition of number plates of vehicles. This system performs the various functions like number plate detection of vehicles, then processing them and using the trained data set for accurately predicting the vehicle number. This system is based upon the image processing technology. Our aim is to design an efficient automatic system with reduced manual work. It can be used in various application like Toll collection, Parking System, Border crossing, traffic control, stolen cars, etc.

# The system consists of mainly four stages to implement the system which are

1. Image acquisition in real time

2. Number plate extraction

3. Number plate segmentation

4. Character recognition


We have incorporated Machine learning and python to obtain optimum results and maximum accuracy.

This will not only reduce manual work, but also error free and efficient process in obtaining the information of the user.

 


PreRequisite
Python Version should be installed 3.7.0 or above. pip should be present.

Steps to run project on local computer
Cloning Repository

 git clone project link
 
After cloning the project move to the project folder and use the following commands to install dependencies.

Virtual environments Use a virtual environment to manage the dependencies for your project, both in development and in production.Virtual environments are independent groups of Python libraries, one for each project. Packages installed for one project will not affect other projects or the operating system's packages.

Intsalling Virtual Environment

 sudo pip3 install virtualenv

create a virtual environment

virtualenv anyname  

Installing Dependencies

pip install requirments.txt  

This will install all the dependencies related to the project.

Now to start the project

python filename.py 

press "q" after each step to proceed for the next one.
